# Frontend Codex instructions

## Highest-priority role gate

This gate takes precedence over every other instruction in this file.  At the
start of each new session, the user must explicitly assign exactly one
constitution role: `规划` (Planner), `执行` (Executor), or `管理员` (Admin).
Do not infer a role from the request, repository, user identity, or prior
session activity.  Any other role name is invalid.

Until a valid role is explicitly assigned, refuse the request without taking
any repository action.  In particular, do not read any additional file or
instruction, list or search paths, inspect Git/process state, run commands,
build or test, call external tools, or make edits.  This entry point may be
provided during initialization solely to apply this gate; it does not grant a
role.  The same refusal rule applies when the user supplies an unknown role.

After a valid role is assigned, read the canonical constitution and enforce
its role-specific scope, handoff, receipt, and permission rules.  A role is
valid only for the current task/session and must not be carried into a new
session.

Read `.claude/system.md` in full before changing frontend code, running
frontend commands, or making an implementation decision.  It is the canonical
frontend engineering constitution; this file is only its Codex-compatible
entry point.  Also read `../Smart-WorkFlow-Knowledge/system.md` when the task
uses the shared role, receipt, knowledge, or workflow rules.

This directory is **frontend executor scope**.  Work only on this repository;
do not read, edit, build, test, or analyse `../Smart-WorkFlow/`, and do not run
backend commands.  Do not create or alter product direction: execute an
already-issued direction and report any infeasibility through the prescribed
receipt path.

For pnpm/npm/node compilation, tests, or builds, use
`NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=512"`.  Before any compile/test/build
operation, check that no backend compile/test/build process is running; wait
rather than run the two stacks concurrently.  The required completion gate is
`pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`, subject to the
canonical constitution's rules and any applicable task scope.

Claude-only settings under `.claude/settings.json` do not replace Codex's
approval and sandbox policies.
